###  Installation
    # Place files here.  Create the directory if it doesn't exist.
    ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/
    
    # The second to last path component is the name of a group that shows up in the XCode new project

### Usage
After you've installed it create a new project using your project template in Xcode's new project 
chooser.  All frameworks have been included that are needed.

### Note
This project template contains a distribution build target, but it's just for convenience.  You'll need 
to change these settings and select your own provisioning profile if you plan on distributing your app.
